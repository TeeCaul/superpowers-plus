AI coding assistants skip the practices that keep bugs out of production. They implement the first idea without weighing alternatives, patch symptoms instead of finding root causes, and declare work done without verifying it. Asking them to behave better in a system prompt doesn't hold: under context pressure, the instructions get forgotten.

superpowers-plus is 124 skills that make an assistant follow those practices, plus the machinery that enforces them from outside the model. Skills give the assistant a procedure: reproduce before fixing, generate three designs before picking one, send a diff to parallel specialist reviewers. Lifecycle hooks and git commit gates check the result. Git runs those gates whether or not the assistant remembers to ask for review.

It builds on Jesse Vincent's [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). Superpowers teaches an agent how to work; superpowers-plus adds more skills and the hooks and gates that make the work hard to skip. It also covers non-coding work: documents, wikis, issue tracking, research.

## Quick Start

Requires bash 4+, git, and Node.js 18+. macOS ships bash 3.2, so run `brew install bash` first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus.git && cd superpowers-plus
bash install.sh                 # skills, hooks, and runtime
bash tools/install-hooks.sh     # git commit and push gates
```

Then tell your assistant what you're doing:

| You say... | What happens |
|------------|--------------|
| "Debug this test failure" | `systematic-debugging` requires a root cause before any fix |
| "Build a new feature for X" | `feature-development` runs brainstorm, debate, plan, TDD, review, verify |
| "Review this code" or `/sp-cr-battery` | `code-review-battery` starts with one combined reviewer and dispatches up to 7 parallel reviewers when the diff calls for specialists |
| "I keep getting the same error" | `think-twice` hands the problem to a fresh sub-agent with no shared context |
| "Check for security issues" | `repo-security-scan` covers secrets, dependencies, risky patterns, and config |
| "I'm about to commit" | `unified-commit-gate` runs lint/build/test, style, review, language, and IP audit |

Full install options (Claude Code plugin, Codex, OpenCode, MCP server, Windows/WSL) are in [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## What Changes

```text
"This test started failing after yesterday's change. Fix it."

Without:  edit code -> test passes -> "Done."
With:     reproduce -> find the root cause -> test hypotheses -> isolate
          -> smallest fix -> verify -> review the diff -> commit gates
```

## Enforcement Outside the Model

Most skill libraries are prompt text. If the model drops the instruction, nothing notices. superpowers-plus puts the checks where the model can't skip them:

- **Git hooks** run the commit gate chain on every `git commit` and `git push`. Changes to `skills/` need a passing code-review sentinel tied to the reviewed content before the commit goes through.
- **Claude Code lifecycle hooks** (including SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, and PreToolUse) route prompts to skills, save a resume prompt before context compaction, block pushes and branch deletions until a human approves them in the session, and stop commits made under the wrong git identity.
- **CI** repeats the IP scan on the PR title and body, because a squash merge builds its commit message from those fields, not from any local commit.

## The AI-Harness: Instruction Context as a Budget

Every skill an agent loads stays in its context window and is re-sent on every model call. superpowers-plus treats that context as a budgeted resource and runs a closed loop over it:

| Stage | Artifact | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Sensor** | [`tools/skill-size-audit.sh`](tools/skill-size-audit.sh) | Ranks every `skill.md` by size and fails when one exceeds the fleet threshold |
| **Actuator** | [`kernel-split`](skills/engineering/kernel-split/skill.md) | Splits a large skill into a small always-loaded kernel and an on-demand reference |
| **Regulator** | [`artifact-budgets`](docs/harness/artifact-budgets.md) | Byte budgets against a committed baseline, so a skill that shrank today can't quietly regrow |

Measured results so far, from the [reduction ledger](docs/harness/reduction-history.md):

| Skill | Before | Kernel after | Reduction |
|-------|-------:|-------------:|----------:|
| progressive-harsh-review | 18,018 B | 8,493 B | 52% |
| debate | 13,660 B | 7,703 B | 43% |
| context-ferry | 10,688 B | 7,122 B | 33% (below the 40% target; safety rules kept resident) |

One rule outranks the byte savings: hard gates and "never" rules always stay in the kernel. That rule is enforced by review, not assumed: review caught all three of these splits moving or deleting safety content (anti-rubber-stamping rules, a required search step, a write-back procedure), and each was restored. Design: [docs/harness/README.md](docs/harness/README.md).

## Standout Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [**code-review-battery**](skills/engineering/code-review-battery/skill.md) | Starts with one combined reviewer (defects, guardrails, standards) and dispatches up to 7 specialist reviewers in parallel when the diff signals design, performance, security, or shell risk. A bug-path verifier joins in bug-fix mode. Configurable quality bar |
| [**debate**](skills/engineering/debate/skill.md) | Three or more options, a comparison matrix, then a red-team pass on the winner before committing to a design |
| [**systematic-debugging**](skills/engineering/systematic-debugging/skill.md) | Reproduce, hypothesize, isolate, fix. No fix until the investigation is complete |
| [**feature-development**](skills/engineering/feature-development/skill.md) | The full lifecycle as one orchestrated sequence, so no phase gets skipped |
| [**llm-skill-review**](skills/engineering/llm-skill-review/skill.md) | Reviews skills as infrastructure that models execute: determinism, shell portability, tool contracts, cross-agent behavior |
| [**context-ferry**](skills/productivity/context-ferry/skill.md) | Writes a self-contained resume prompt before context compaction, so long sessions keep their state |
| [**detecting-ai-slop**](skills/writing/detecting-ai-slop/skill.md) | Scores text 0-100 for machine-generated patterns across lexical, structural, semantic, and stylometric signals |
| [**evolution-loop**](skills/observability/evolution-loop/skill.md) | Scans failures for recurring patterns and proposes skill updates |

All 124 skills: [docs/SKILLS.md](docs/SKILLS.md). How they connect: [docs/SKILL_TAXONOMY.md](docs/SKILL_TAXONOMY.md).

## Platform Support

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|

| **Augment Code** | Full: skills, routing, commit and push gates, MCP integrations |
| **Codex, OpenCode** | Skills, via the [platform install guides](docs/INSTALLATION.md). Git gates work with any assistant because git runs them; Claude Code lifecycle hooks do not apply |

## Building on It

```text
obra/superpowers (Jesse Vincent, MIT)
    └── superpowers-plus (this repo)
            └── your-org-skills (private overlay)
```

All 14 obra/superpowers skills are bundled here, nine of them hardened with extra enforcement gates; upstream changes are merged periodically. Teams can add a private repo on top that shadows or extends these skills with their own issue tracker, wiki, and conventions. See the [Enterprise Adopters Guide](docs/ENTERPRISE_ADOPTERS_GUIDE.md), including its security checklist for overlays.
